[00:15.88] Well, I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
[00:21.66] Reminds me of the times we've shared
[00:24.68] Makes me wish that you were here, 'cause
[00:26.76] Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
[00:31.83] Well, all the songs have been erased
[00:35.01] Guess I've learned from my mistakes, well
[00:55.51] 
[00:37.45] Open the past and present now, and we are there
[00:42.65] Story to tell, and I am listening
[00:47.88] Open the past and present and the future too
[00:52.95] It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you
[01:14.45] 
[00:58.09] Well, loose ends tied in knots, leaving a lump down in my throat
[01:03.02] Well, gagging on a souvenir
[01:05.88] Lived to fill another year
[01:08.44] We'll drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds
[01:13.49] Well, leaving myself open wide
[01:16.65] Living out a sacrifice, well
[01:30.65] 
[01:19.84] Open the past and present now, and we are there
[01:24.38] Story to tell, and I am listening
[01:29.47] Open the past and present and the future too
[01:34.55] It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you
[01:56.05] 
[01:44.66] If you got no one
[01:47.46] And I've got no place to go
[01:50.15] Would it be alright?
[01:52.76] Could it be alright?
[02:02.76] 
[02:05.22] Well, I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor
[02:10.80] Reminds me of the times we shared
[02:13.83] Makes me wish that you were here, 'cause
[02:16.66] Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
[02:21.65] Well, ll the songs have been erased
[02:24.48] Guess I've learned from my mistakes, well
[02:44.98] 
[02:27.14] Open the past and present now, and we are there
[02:31.93] Story to tell, and I am listening
[02:37.44] Open the past and present and the future too
[02:42.50] It's all I've got, and I'm giving it to you
