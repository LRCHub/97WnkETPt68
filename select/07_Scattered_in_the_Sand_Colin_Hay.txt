Somewhere along the river bend
Maybe we will meet again
Things we thought were there at our command
Scattered in the sand, scattered in the sand

I saw the house on Minerva Lane
The gate was shut with lock and chain
Memories of what once was grand
Scattered in the sand, scattered in the sand

I watched you sleeping as you drifted away
Love's for the keeping I still hear you say

I saw you in my flying dreams
On the bridge from here to there it seems
Only then I spread your ashes where
The ocean meets the land
Scattered in the sand, scattered in the sand

I watched you sleeping as you drifted away
Love's for the keeping I still hear you say
I watched you sleeping as you drifted away
Love's for the keeping
