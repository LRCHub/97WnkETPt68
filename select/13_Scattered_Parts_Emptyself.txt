I'm trying to stay true but I've got liars in my head.
Got pliers in my bed just to pry 'em off my neck.
They crawl up in my ear and try to keep me in the wrong,
And they'll be taking over if I sleep for very long.

I'll be saying things I know I don't believe,
I'll be reaching out to grab what I know that I don't need.

It can take a while for the clarity to return.
I get lost, but I'm trying to learn.

I was hoping you could see
Through the scattered parts of me
That hide the truth away from you.

It's a shame that almost everything that helps you go astray
Is everywhere you look and you can find it any day.
But the things that help you see yourself you rarely come across. They barely can be seen in the clutter of the false.
So when I'm up above I leave reminders for myself,
To find my way back up if I'm running out of breath.
To help me find the center till my balance will return.
I get lost, but I'm trying to learn.

I was hoping you could see
Through the scattered parts of me
That hide the truth away from you.

I was hoping you could see
Through the scattered parts of me
That hide the truth away from you.
